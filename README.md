# Music List Compare
In the unlikely situation where you have a bunch of sound files in a directory and a big spreadsheet **(delimited text files)** with the metadata of those files, *maybe* this program might be of some help!

Personally, I found that going through each file manually and checking that the metadata matched with my spreadsheet was *very* taxing. 

So instead of doing that myself, I made a program to do it for me. This program is a new and improved version from its predecessor which you can find [here](https://github.com/adaeo/MP3-List). I made that one when I was a **much** worse at coding, so I wanted to make a new *slightly not as bad* successor.

# Current State
*This is still a work in progress... this README will be updated as the program evolves.*
